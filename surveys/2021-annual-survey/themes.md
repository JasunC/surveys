## Metadata


* Can we de-bias responses?
  - Non-users section
  - Can we estimate population info from survey?
* Data for cohort analysis (Users)


* Non-Users
  * We want to better understand the perspective of non-users of Rust. 
  * Questions: this group is very unlikely to be representative of the entire population of Rust. What can we learn from them?


# By audience

For most of these questions, want to know change year on year as well as absolute values.

## Implementers

* What should be worked on?
  - What are people's blockers?
  - Sources of friction?
  - Popularity of platforms/domains/tools/etc.
* Is work that has been done having a positive impact?

## Potential users

Individuals or decision makers. Primary purpose of survey is supplying evidence

* Is Rust mature? (I.e., are there many users in a particular domain/organisational context/etc)
* Are Rust users happy?
* Are Rust users being successful?
* What problems/risks should one be aware of?

## Rust leadership

* Understand composition of user base and potential users
* Are we attracting and retaining users?
* Is effort expended leading to success?
* Are resources being correctly allocated?
* Are our assumptions correct? (Are there scenarios or groups of (potential) users that are underserved?)
* Is the community meeting its goals?
  - Are people able to participate?
  - Are there biases relative to all users/wider industry/global population?

## Sponsors

Evidence that Rust is a project worth being involved with

* Number of users and demographic info.
* How is Rust being used?
