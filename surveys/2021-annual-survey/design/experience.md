# What is the experience of Rust like?

## The Rust programming experience (compiler, lang, tooling)

* Stability of the language
  * Do people feel that their code is being broken?
  * How often and what is the severity of this breakage?
  * In general, do people feel like Rust's stability guarantees are upheld?
  * How often do people *need* to reach for nightly for the compiler or core tooling?
* The Rust compiler as a productive tool
  * Is the perception of {compile times, binary size, artifact disk space (i.e., the target folder)} getting better or worse over time?
* What are "core tools" for users (i.e., they are an indispensable part of the Rust programming experience?)
* How is the IDE experience with Rust?
* How reliable is tooling and how happy are people in general with the user experience?
* Do people find the edition experience relatively uneventful?
* Does Rust work well for the platform they are targeting (i.e., the compile target)?
* Can people usually find the library their looking for? If not, what domains seemed to be the most underserved?
* Questions which gauge attitudes to potential new features.

Useful for implementers to know where to focus their work and for leadership to be aware of any major problems which need more resources.

## Learning Rust

Rust has a reputation for being difficult to learn. It would be useful to know if this reputation is supported by data about users and if this is changing over time.

* Perception of Rust's learning curve?
* Do people feel like Rust's learning curve is worth it?
* How long does it take to learn Rust

The audience for this data is leadership and educators. However, while it's _interesting_ to learn about people's perceptions of how difficult it is to learn Rust or certain parts of Rust, how actionable is this information?


## Community experience

Try to understand how inclusive the Rust community is and is perceived to be. We want to know if people feel welcomed or excluded by the community (particularly interesting when analyzed in conjunction with demographic data or participation level). We might ask about specific incidents or experiences to try and get more objective data, though this area is inherently subjective.

Try to understand the level of participation in the community, current, past, and future (intentions). Consider team membership, contributions (PRs (code, tests, docs, ...), filing issues, meetings, triage) to the core project and crates, communication (watch meetings, participate/lurk in forums like Zulip, internals, users, r/rust), attended meetups/conferences, read news, participate in private communities (e.g., Rust interest groups or Slack channels at work). Might want to understand if people would like to participate more or why people participate or don't participate.

Useful for Rust leadership to assist with community building. Potential users to gauge the strength of the community and potential for their participation.
