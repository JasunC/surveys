# Process

See [2021-annual-survey#tentative-timeline](https://github.com/rust-lang/surveys/tree/main/surveys/2021-annual-survey#tentative-timeline) for the 2021 timeline.

## Design doc

See also [design.md](design.md).

We intend to start the survey design process by writing a design document. Starting with the 'requirements': the lessons we hope to learn from the survey, we will work backwards to the data we hope to collect (in broad terms and including the cohorts we may wish to analyze), and finally to the questions we wish to ask in the survey.


## Requirement collection

To ensure we meet the requirements of 'clients' of the survey (i.e., people who will consume the processed result data), we intend to ask the following groups of people for input (see [tracking issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/surveys/issues/3)):

* Core team
* Foundation committee
* Rust project teams 
* Leads of active sub-teams working groups
* Select external teams that have shown interest in gaining insights through the survey
