# Survey design

## Constraints

* Trend analysis - trend data can be particularly useful, to analyze trends we need to ask the same questions (or at least 'compatible' questions) from year to year. We should identify questions from previous years we should ask this year in order to perform trend analysis. Note that there is some inevitable tension here between using the same question and improving questions based on lessons learned. However, in many cases trend data are still useful even if there is a known 'step' in the data due to changing the way a question is asked.
* Survey length. In general, the longer a survey, the lower the response rate will be. This can be mitigated somewhat by asking the most important questions first. We are not aware that the length of previous years has had a significant effect, however, the survey has been getting subjectively 'long'.


## Usefulness of data

We should reflect on *why* we are collecting data and what are the practical use cases for doing so. Data collection might be motivated by:

* A specific use such as driving a team's work, e.g., asking which editor users prefer might help the IDEs team prioritise work on editor integration.
* General understanding of the project and community, e.g., asking demographic information about users might help the core and community teams understand the characteristics of the community and better target D&I work.
* Usefulness in marketing Rust, e.g., showing a year on year increase in Rust usage is useful for general marketing of the language and for specifically arguing for use of Rust for a single team or company.
* Curiosity, e.g., knowing how difficult Rust is to learn feels like a useful thing to know, but is unlikely to actually how anybody does their work or be useful for marketing. Although, we might like to see this metric decrease over time, it is unlikley to be objective enough for any decrease to be significant, and even if it were, it's not clear that such information is useful.

We should make an effort to reduce questions which do not have provide useful data. At the limit, we should ask if the survey in its entirety is producing enough useful data to be worthwhile (given the relatively high cost of producing the survey, analysing the data, etc.).
